# Chat App using ReactJS and Firebase

This is a chat application built with ReactJS and Firebase. It allows users to communicate in real-time using text messages. The application utilizes the Firestore database in Firebase to store and retrieve chat messages.

## Features

- User authentication: Users can sign up and log in to the application using their email and password. Firebase Authentication is used for user management.
- Real-time messaging: Users can send and receive messages in real-time. Messages are synced across devices and appear instantly.
- Message history: The chat application keeps a record of all messages exchanged between users, allowing them to view past conversations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/akrem2005/firebasechat.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd chat-app`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Configuration

1. Create a Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com).
2. Enable Firebase Authentication and Firestore in the Firebase console.
3. In the project directory, open the `src/firebase.js` file.
4. Replace the Firebase configuration object with your own Firebase project credentials:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
};

firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
```

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY`, `YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN`, etc., with the corresponding values from your Firebase project.

## Usage

1. Start the development server: `npm start`
2. Open the application in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
